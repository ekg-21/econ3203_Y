## Task Breakdown ##

- [ ] **Introduction**: summary of the task and the main findings (1 page or less)
- [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  -  [ ] data visualisation
  -  [x] correlation matrix
  -  [ ] pairwise plots
  -  [ ] etc.
Tell some preliminary story behind the data.
- [ ] **Models and methods**. Which models/methods are used and why, how the models
are trained, etc. with sufficient justifications. You need to consider several models.
The description should be detailed enough so that other data scientists are able to
implement the task. All the numerical results are reported up to four decimal places.
This part may have subsections for each model/sub-model and overall final model
comparison/selection.
- [ ] **Discussion**: discuss model interpretability (if any), cautionary notes, etc. In particular,
suggest and motivate potential use of an asymmetric loss for future analysis (a
numeric analysis with an asymmetric loss is not required).
- [ ] **References** (I suggest at least 3)

Clearly and appropriately present any relevant graphs and tables to support your
finding. The page limit is **20 pages** including EVERYTHING: appendix, relevant output (but
not code!), graphs, tables, etc
